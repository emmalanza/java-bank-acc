# Bank Account
This repository implements a bank account model with various types of accounts, including "Savings Account" and "Current Account," using an object-oriented approach. The core functionalities include account deposit, withdrawal, monthly statement generation, and interest calculation. The program also models the behavior of savings accounts with activity status and checking accounts with overdraft capabilities.

This solution was developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles to ensure high code quality and test coverage.
